Introduction
</font></b></p>
<font face="Arial">
<p>
Yan Liu is Senior Research Programmer at the <a href="http://ncsa.illinois.edu">National Center for Supercomputing Applications</a> and the Department of Geography and Geographic Information Science. He obtained his Ph.D. in Informatics from the <a href="http://illinois.edu" target="_blank">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a>, M.CS from the <a href="http://www.cs.uiowa.edu">University of Iowa</a>, and B.S. and M.E. from <a href="http://www.whu.edu.cn">Wuhan University</a>, China. </p>
<p>
Yan's primary interest is in the development of high-performance and scalable algorithms and software, with a particular interest in high-performance heuristic algorithms. He has designed scalable approaches for large-scale geospatial optimization problems, harnessing massive supercomputing resources on cyberinfrastructure. He was a lead developer of <a href="http://www.cigi.illinois.edu/dokuwiki/doku.php/projects/gisolve/index">GISolve middleware</a> -- a leading GIS solution on cyberinfrastructure (July 2007 to September 2010), the project manager of the NSF <a href="http://cybergis.org">CyberGIS</a> project (October 2010 to April 2012), and is now leading an initiative to develop extreme scale geospatial codes.  At the <a href="http://cybergis.illinois.edu">CyberGIS Center</a>, he leads the software architecting and development of CyberGIS core capabilities and funded projects. He is also a staff scientist in <a href="http://xsede.org">XSEDE</a> (the successor of <a href="http://teragrid.org">TeraGrid</a>) to provide advanced cyberinfrastructure consulting for domain-specific scientific computing, performance profiling and optimization, and science gateways. </p>
<p>
Working with hydrologists, he developed a scalable computational solution to <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/discoveries/disc_summ.jsp?cntn_id=189556">continental flood inundation mapping</a> in the NSF National Flood Interoperability Experiment project. CFIM produces a <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.24234.41925/1">high-resolution hydrologic terrain for the conterminous U.S.</a> and was used in August 2017 for Hurricane Harvey relief and recovery in the State of Texas. He is the author of a high-performance <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.swevo.2016.04.004">political redistricting</a> software, which scales up to 131,072 processor cores on <a href="http://bluewaters.ncsa.illinois.edu">Blue Waters</a>, the most powerful supercomputer in the world on a university campus (as of May 2017), to provide a <a href="http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/4/10/15211122/algorithm-end-partisan-gerrymandering">supercomputing solution</a> to the legal study of <a href="http://cho.pol.illinois.edu/wendy/papers/talismanic.pdf">gerrymandering</a>. 
</p>

Yan enjoys athletic pursuits. He goes to gym to keep his work and life in balance. He is a regular fixture at Soccer Planetâ€™s indoor leagues and enjoyed playing basketball with the Kenney Gym Recreation Club.  When he has vacation time, he likes to travel to national and state parks.
